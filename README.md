If you are not using Colab, the suggested method is to run this in a virtual environment:

start your virtual environment
```sh
virtualenv --python=python3.10.2 env
```

upgrade pip if you want to upgrade
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```
enter virtualenv
```sh
source env/bin/activate
```
install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
do your stuff...

leave virtualenv
```sh
deactivate
```
